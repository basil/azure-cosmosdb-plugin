<p>The Jenkins Cosmos DB plugin caches the client that interacts with Cosmos DB, if you're using folder based
    credentials then the client is cached per job rather than globally.
This means that on the start of each new job the client needs to be initialized which takes a few seconds.</p>

<p>If your credentials are stored in the 'Jenkins' credentials store or another global one it's recommended to enable this option
as it will save some time in your jobs.</p>
